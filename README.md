## Dictionary File
The project expects a dictionary file to be located in the folder that you are running the project in.
The file must be:
  - named BoggleDictionary.txt
  - words of completely **lowercase** letters (no special characters, numbers, uppercase, etc.)
  - one word per line (words and newlines only)

### Script
Included in the repository is a script - PrepareScript.sh - that will download and prepare a dictionary.
The process for running the script (demonstrated in the video) is as follows:
  1. Type `chmod 755 PrepareScript.sh` into terminal
  2. Run `./PrepareScript.sh`

If you decide to use a different dictionary, make sure it follows all of the required properties.

## Building the file
  - option one: gcc...
  - option two: make
