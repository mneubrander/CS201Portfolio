Hello! Welcome to Boggle Game, a mind-boggling game of word fun.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW TO PLAY:
    The goal of the game is to connect the letters on the board to form words. You may
    connect letters in any direction (up, down, left, right, diagonal), but you may not
    use a letter more than once (for instance, if there are two different 'a' tiles on the
    board, you may use each, but you may not hit a single space twice). You will have three minutes
    to do this! After three minutes, any word you enter will not be counted.

SCORING:
    The boggle words are scored according to their word length. Of course, words must be in the
    dictionary being used to get any points.

          < 2 letters: 0  Points
          3-4 letters: 1  Point
          5   letters: 2  Points
          6   letters: 3  Points
          7   letters: 5  Points
          8+  letters: 11 Points

MODES OF GAMEPLAY:

    As you can see, there are several modes of gameplay! They all follow the same general rules, but
    each has its own characteristics.

    VS COMPUTER:
      In playing against the computer, you will type in all of the words you have found and receive your score.
      The computer will then print all the words it found (which will be all of them). Winning will be impossible, but
      you can try to tie for a real challenge!
      Once you enter playing against computer mode, you may play several matches in a row, and the computer will keep track
      of the number of wins for a you and the computer (until you exit this mode). You may change the board size between matches.

    VS COMPUTER, REDUCED DIFFICULTY:
      Just like vs. computer, but the computer only prints and scores a portion of the words it finds - now, you can win!

    PLAYER VS PLAYER:
      Each of two players will have a turn to enter their words (on the same board) on a three minute timer.
      you may play several matches in a row, and the computer will keep track of the number of wins for each player
      (until you exit this mode). You may change the board size between matches.

    ONE PLAYER:
      Though initially this may seem like playing against the computer, it is quite different - the
      only person you can lose to (or beat!) is yourself. Here, the computer keeps track of the high score of
      your consecutive matches. You may not change board size between matches, as comparing raw scores between different
      size boards doesn't make sense.
